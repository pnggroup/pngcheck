# pngcheck 4.0.0

pngcheck is a command-line utility to check PNG image files,
including animated PNG, for validity
and to give information about metadate inside the file
(apart from the actual image data).

This version was derived from pngcheck 3.0.3
(see [3.0.3 README](./README-303)) and adds the following new
features from [PNG Third Edition](https://w3c.github.io/png/):

- Coding Independent Code Points [`cICP`](https://w3c.github.io/png/#cICP-chunk)
- Mastering Display Color Volume [`mDCV`](https://w3c.github.io/png/#mDCV-chunk)
- Content Light Level Information [`cLLI`](https://w3c.github.io/png/#cLLI-chunk)
- Animated PNG [`acTL`](https://w3c.github.io/png/#acTL-chunk), [`fcTL`](https://w3c.github.io/png/#fcTL-chunk) and [`fdAT`](https://w3c.github.io/png/#fdAT-chunk)

It also warns if [`eXIf`](https://w3c.github.io/png/#eXIf) is found after the image data [`IDAT`](https://w3c.github.io/png/#11IDAT),
which will be ignored by web browsers
and is [no longer valid](https://w3c.github.io/png/#5ChunkOrdering) in PNG Third Edition.

Sample usage:
